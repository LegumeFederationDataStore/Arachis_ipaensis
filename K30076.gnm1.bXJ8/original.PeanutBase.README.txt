Initial notes:
March 15, 2014

Files in this directory include the scaffold assemblies for Arachis ipaensis
(Aipa2s.split6.fa.gz), and the pseudomolecule assemblies, version 1.0 for the
genome. The intact pseudomolecules plus the remaining scaffolds are in
the fasta file Araip_v1.0.20140821.fa.gz

Directory legend:
  RM - RepeatMask-ed, using Arachis repeats provided by David Bertioli et al.
  
  by_scaff - The pseudomolecule sequences are in multifasta format, in scaffold
  chunks. Definition lines give scaffold name and orientation.
  
  Not marked "by_scaff" - these pseudomolecule sequences are "entire", with a
  single definition line at the top, e.g. >Araip.B01.

In the "entire" versions (not marked "by_scaff"), the scaffold sequences have
been concatenated (after ordering and orienting), separated by spacer sequences
of 10,000 "n"s.

---------
NOTE added May 20, 2014: the scaffold file Aipa2s.split2.fa has been replaced with
an updated file Aipa2s.split5.fa to reflect the scaffolds used in the 1.0 assemblies.
The earlier file contained some "split" scaffolds with different split locations
than in the final assembly.

---------
NOTE added August 24, 2014:
The scaffold Aipa130 in Araip.B_unplaced was redundant with Aipa130_1 in Araip.B09
and Aipa130_2 in Araip.B05, and has been removed from the August 21 version of Araip.B_unplaced
in both Araip_v1.0_by_scaff/ and Araip_v1.0_by_scaff_RM/ .

An additional set of 640 very poor-quality scffolds were removed from the 2014-08-24 version.
These scaffolds had no predicted gene models, and < 2000 nt of [ATCG] or > 80% Ns.

File Aipa2s.split6.fa replaces Aipa2s.split5.fa, consistent with the August 24 changes.
This contains all scaffolds, regardless of quality or size.
File Araip_v1.0_20140908.fa.gz contains only the scaffolds used in the main assembly (i.e.
pseudomolecules and unplaced scaffolds).

---------
NOTE added July 13, 2015:
The following "split" saffolds were found to be redundant in the
"all scaffolds" file, Aipa2s.split6.fa. These were not used in the pseudomolecule assembly,
and so have been removed from a patched "all scaffolds" file, Aipa2s.split7.fa :
  Aipa102_3 Aipa119_3 Aipa13_3 Aipa151_3 Aipa15_3 Aipa1_3 Aipa21_3 Aipa232_3
  Aipa246_3 Aipa271_3 Aipa2_3 Aipa32_3 Aipa69_3 Aipa81_5 Aipa90_4 Aipa90_5 Aipa9_3
