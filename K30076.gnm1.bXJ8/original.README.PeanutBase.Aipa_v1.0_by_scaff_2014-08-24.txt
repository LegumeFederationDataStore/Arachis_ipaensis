NOTE added August 24, 2014:
The scaffold Aipa130 in Araip.B_unplaced was redundant with Aipa130_1 in Araip.B09
and Aipa130_2 in Araip.B05, and has been removed from the August 24 version of Araip.B_unplaced
in both Araip_v1.0_by_scaff/ and Araip_v1.0_by_scaff_RM/ .

An additional set of 640 very poor-quality scffolds were removed from the 2014-08-24 version.
These scaffolds had no predicted gene models, and < 2000 nt of [ATCG] or > 80% Ns.
