Arachis genome assemblies: data usage agreement

As a public service, the Peanut Genome Consortium (PGC) is making the
Arachis duranensis (accession V14167) and Arachis ipaensis
(accession K30076) genome sequence and annotations available before scientific 
publication according to the Ft. Lauderdale Accord. For public access we are making
these data sets from the Peanut Genome Project and our collaborators prior to 
peer-reviewed publication of the data. We are making this data
available with the expectation and desire to publish this data in a reasonable
time without preemption by other groups. By accessing these data, you agree
not to publish any articles containing analyses of genes or genomic data
on a whole genome or chromosome scale prior to publication by the PGC
and/or its collaborators of a comprehensive genome analysis ("Reserved
Analyses"). "Reserved analyses" include the identification of complete (whole
genome) sets of genomic features such as genes, gene families, regulatory
elements, repeat structures, GC content, or any other genome feature, and
whole-genome- or chromosome- scale comparisons with other species
including other peanut species and cultivars. For specific questions about
data use please send your inquiry to Peanut Genome Consortium via
http://www.peanutbase.org/contact.

If you will be employing the data for non-reserved analyses, such as cloning
a gene of interest, designing mapping panels or to analyze a gene family etc.,
please reference the "Peanut Genome Project" as your citation.
